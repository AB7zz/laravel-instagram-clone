# How to start this app

1. Open your terminal
2. Type "npm run watch"
3. Open another tab in your terminal and type in "php artisan serve"
4. Hopefully that should work!


# How to test this app

1. You MUST know how to use instagram because..obviously, it's an instagram clone. If not, you're probably living under a rock.

# Tutorial I watched to learn

# Drawbacks

1. Didn't add a like option to like pictures
2. Any honestly it's not a 100% clone of instagram because Insta is a huge app and this was a small beginners project to learn the basics of uploading into SQL table, edit, update, etc. using the PHP Framework Laravel

# Happy Coding!
